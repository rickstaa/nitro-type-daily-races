# Nitro Type - Show Daily Races

This repository contains a user script that enhances the team roster table on the [Nitro Type](https://www.nitrotype.com/)  team page by adding a new column that displays the average number of daily races completed by each team member. This information can be useful for team leaders who want to track the performance of their team members and make informed decisions about promotions and demotions.

## Installation

1.  Install a userscript manager for your browser. For example, [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) for Chrome or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.
2.  Go to the [Nitro Type - Show Daily Races](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/473517-nitro-type-show-daily-races) script page.
3.  Click the Install button.
4.  Go to your Nitro Type team page and refresh the page.
5.  You should now see a new column in the team roster table that contains the daily races.

## How it works

The script works by adding a new column to the team statistics table that shows the average number of daily races per team member. The script calculates this average by dividing the total number of team races by the number of days a team member has been on the team.
