# Nitro Type - Daily Races

This repository contains a small user script that adds the average daily races to the team roster table on the [NitroType](https://www.nitrotype.com/) team page. This information can be useful when deciding which team members to promote and which members to kick.

## Installation

1.  Install a userscript manager for your browser. For example, [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) for Chrome or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.
2.  Go to the [Nitro Type - Daily Races]() script page.
3.  Click the Install button.
4.  Go to your Nitro Type team page and refresh the page.
5.  You should now see a new column in the team roster table that contains the daily races.

## How it works

The script works by adding a new column to the team statistics table that shows the average number of daily races per team member. The script calculates this average by dividing the total number of team races by the number of days a team member has been on the team.
